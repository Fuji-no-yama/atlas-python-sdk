AML.TA0009,x-mitre-tactic--b08d83b4-fdc7-4e5f-93ef-f4479a2f2a14,Collection,"The adversary is trying to gather machine learning artifacts and other related information relevant to their goal.

Collection consists of techniques adversaries may use to gather information and the sources information is collected from that are relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives.
Frequently, the next goal after collecting data is to steal (exfiltrate) the ML artifacts, or use the collected information to stage future operations.
Common target sources include software repositories, container registries, model repositories, and object stores.

Discovery consists of techniques an adversary may use to gain knowledge about the system and internal network.
These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding how to act.
They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and what's around their entry point in order to discover how it could benefit their current objective.
Native operating system tools are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.

Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.
Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data.
For example, an adversary might use a remote access tool to run a PowerShell script that does [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/).

Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network.
Data may be stolen for its valuable intellectual property, or for use in staging future operations.

Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.

Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes.
Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data.
In some cases, business processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries' goals.
These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.

The target system could be a network, mobile device, or an edge device such as a sensor platform.
The machine learning capabilities used by the system could be local with onboard or cloud-enabled ML capabilities.

Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within the system.

ML Attack Staging consists of techniques adversaries use to prepare their attack on the target ML model.
Techniques can include training proxy models, poisoning the target model, and crafting adversarial data to feed the target model.
Some of these techniques can be performed in an offline manner and are thus difficult to mitigate.
These techniques are often used to achieve the adversary's end goal.

AML.TA0000,x-mitre-tactic--55db50f4-add2-4407-a20c-dc968ac3189d,ML Model Access,"The adversary is attempting to gain some level of access to a machine learning model.

ML Model Access enables techniques that use various types of access to the machine learning model that can be used by the adversary to gain information, develop attacks, and as a means to input data to the model.
The level of access can range from the full knowledge of the internals of the model to access to the physical environment where data is collected for use in the machine learning model.
The adversary may use varying levels of model access during the course of their attack, from staging the attack to impacting the target system.

Access to an ML model may require access to the system housing the model, the model may be publically accessible via an API, or it may be accessed indirectly via interaction with a product or service that utilizes ML as part of its processes.

Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
Techniques used for persistence often involve leaving behind modified ML artifacts such as poisoned training data or backdoored ML models.

AML.TA0012,x-mitre-tactic--c920f814-50c3-4d9b-b0c9-8a910b29d357,Privilege Escalation,"The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access include:
- SYSTEM/root level
- local administrator
- user account with admin-like access
- user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function

These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.

Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting.
Such information may include details of the victim organizations' machine learning capabilities and research efforts.
This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to obtain relevant ML artifacts, targeting ML capabilities used by the victim, tailoring attacks to the particular models used by the victim, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts.
