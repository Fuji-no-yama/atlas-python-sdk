Infrastructure can also include physical components such as countermeasures that degrade or disrupt AI components or sensors, including printed materials, wearables, or disguises.

Use of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation.
Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services.

ML artifacts can aid in an adversary's ability to [Create Proxy ML Model](/techniques/AML.T0005).
If these artifacts include pieces of the actual model in production, they can be used to directly [Craft Adversarial Data](/techniques/AML.T0043).

Victim-owned websites may contain technical details about their ML-enabled products or services.
Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info.
These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.

Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information.
This information may help adversaries tailor their attacks (e.g. [Adversarial ML Attacks](/techniques/AML.T0017.000) or [Manual Modification](/techniques/AML.T0043.003)).

Once a target has been identified, an adversary will likely try to identify any pre-existing work that has been done for this class of models.
This will include not only reading academic papers that may identify the particulars of a successful attack, but also identifying pre-existing implementations of those attacks.

The adversary can use this information to identify targets for attack, or to tailor an existing attack to make it more effective.
Organizations often use open source model architectures trained on additional proprietary data in production.
Knowledge of this underlying architecture allows the adversary to craft more realistic proxy models ([Create Proxy ML Model](/techniques/AML.T0005)).
An adversary can search these resources for publications for authors employed at the victim organization.

Research materials may exist as academic papers published in [Journals and Conference Proceedings](/techniques/AML.T0000.000), or stored in [Pre-Print Repositories](/techniques/AML.T0000.001), as well as [Technical Blogs](/techniques/AML.T0000.002).
