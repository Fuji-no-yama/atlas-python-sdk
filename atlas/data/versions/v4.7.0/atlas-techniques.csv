Inference API access can be a source of information to the adversary ([Discover ML Model Ontology](/techniques/AML.T0013), [Discover ML Model Family](/techniques/AML.T0014)), a means of staging the attack ([Verify Attack](/techniques/AML.T0042), [Craft Adversarial Data](/techniques/AML.T0043)), or for introducing data to the target system for Impact ([Evade ML Model](/techniques/AML.T0015), [Erode ML Model Integrity](/techniques/AML.T0031)).

Many systems rely on the same models provided via an inference API, which means they share the same vulnerabilities.

Infrastructure can also include physical components such as countermeasures that degrade or disrupt AI components or sensors, including printed materials, wearables, or disguises.

Use of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation.
Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services.

These machine learning artifacts may include the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data, model configurations and parameters.
An adversary will be particularly interested in artifacts hosted by or associated with the victim organization as they may represent what that organization uses in a production environment.
Adversaries may identify artifact repositories via other resources associated with the victim organization (e.g. [Search Victim-Owned Websites](/techniques/AML.T0003) or [Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials](/techniques/AML.T0000)).
These ML artifacts often provide adversaries with details of the ML task and approach.

ML artifacts can aid in an adversary's ability to [Create Proxy ML Model](/techniques/AML.T0005).
If these artifacts include pieces of the actual model in production, they can be used to directly [Craft Adversarial Data](/techniques/AML.T0043).
Acquiring some artifacts requires registration (providing user details such email/name), AWS keys, or written requests, and may require the adversary to [Establish Accounts](/techniques/AML.T0021).

Artifacts might be hosted on victim-controlled infrastructure, providing the victim with some information on who has accessed that data.

The adversary uses [White-Box Optimization](/techniques/AML.T0043.000) on the proxy models to generate adversarial examples.

Effects can range from misclassification, to missed detections, to maximizing energy consumption.
Typically, the modification is constrained in magnitude or location so that a human still perceives the data as if it were unmodified, but human perceptibility may not always be a concern depending on the adversary's intended effect.
For example, an adversarial input for an image classification task is an image the machine learning model would misclassify, but a human would still recognize as containing the correct class.

Depending on the adversary's knowledge of and access to the target model, the adversary may use different classes of algorithms to develop the adversarial example such as [White-Box Optimization](/techniques/AML.T0043.000), [Black-Box Optimization](/techniques/AML.T0043.001), [Black-Box Transfer](/techniques/AML.T0043.002), or [Manual Modification](/techniques/AML.T0043.003).

In comparison to [Journals and Conference Proceedings](/techniques/AML.T0000.000) and [Pre-Print Repositories](/techniques/AML.T0000.001) this material will often contain more practical aspects of the machine learning system.
This could include underlying technologies and frameworks used, and possibly some information about the API access and use case.
This will help the adversary better understand how that organization is using machine learning internally and the details of their approach that could aid in tailoring an attack.

AML.T0005.000,attack-pattern--75e15967-69df-4bdf-b662-979fb1e56c3e,Train Proxy via Gathered ML Artifacts,"Proxy models may be trained from ML artifacts (such as data, model architectures, and pre-trained models) that are representative of the target model gathered by the adversary.
This can be used to develop attacks that require higher levels of access than the adversary has available or as a means to validate pre-existing attacks without interacting with the target model.

AML.T0005.001,attack-pattern--a3660a2d-f6e5-4f1b-9618-332cceb389c8,Train Proxy via Replication,"Adversaries may replicate a private model.
By repeatedly querying the victim's [AI Model Inference API Access](/techniques/AML.T0040), the adversary can collect the target model's inferences into a dataset.
The inferences are used as labels for training a separate model offline that will mimic the behavior and performance of the target model.

A replicated model that closely mimic's the target model is a valuable resource in staging the attack.
The adversary can use the replicated model to [Craft Adversarial Data](/techniques/AML.T0043) for various purposes (e.g. [Evade ML Model](/techniques/AML.T0015), [Spamming ML System with Chaff Data](/techniques/AML.T0046)).

AML.T0011.000,attack-pattern--be6ef5c5-1ecb-486d-9743-42085bd2c256,Unsafe ML Artifacts,"Adversaries may develop unsafe ML artifacts that when executed have a deleterious effect.
The adversary can use this technique to establish persistent access to systems.
These models may be introduced via a [ML Supply Chain Compromise](/techniques/AML.T0010).

Serialization of models is a popular technique for model storage, transfer, and loading.
However, this format without proper checking presents an opportunity for code execution.

AML.T0055,attack-pattern--04d61746-9df1-468e-99d3-0a4685856deb,Unsecured Credentials,"Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.
These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. bash history), environment variables, operating system, or application-specific repositories (e.g. Credentials in Registry), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. private keys).

Users may inadvertently execute unsafe code introduced via [ML Supply Chain Compromise](/techniques/AML.T0010).
Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link.

Credentials may take the form of usernames and passwords of individual user accounts or API keys that provide access to various ML resources and services.

Compromised credentials may provide access to additional ML artifacts and allow the adversary to perform [Discover ML Artifacts](/techniques/AML.T0007).
Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privileges such as write access to ML artifacts used during development or production.

AML.T0042,attack-pattern--b587a898-010b-4b2f-98a4-379d7c36c9e0,Verify Attack,"Adversaries can verify the efficacy of their attack via an inference API or access to an offline copy of the target model.
This gives the adversary confidence that their approach works and allows them to carry out the attack at a later time of their choosing.
The adversary may verify the attack once but use it against many edge devices running copies of the target model.
The adversary may verify their attack digitally, then deploy it in the [Physical Environment Access](/techniques/AML.T0041) at a later time.
Verifying the attack may be hard to detect since the adversary can use a minimal number of queries or an offline copy of the model.

Adversarial examples trained in this manner are most effective against the target model.
